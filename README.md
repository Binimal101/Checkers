# Checkers
Official Repo for my Console Checkers game

Start by running main and choosing wheather or not you want to load or create a game
Insert coordinates one at a time, 2 coordinate pairs per turn(x,y of piece), (x, y of space).
First to depreciate enemy units wins, stalemate and draw features are implemented.
